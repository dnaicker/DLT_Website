                                        The need for SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity) in the World Wide Web is to introduce forms of identity management that obscure personal data transmitted and housed between online services to reduce the amount of illicit user tracking for profitable gain and mishandling of personal data that would compromise a persons safety in the physical world. The immutability of the distributed ledger provides a layer of authenticity from which one can issue uniquely generated identifiers for credentials and wallets. 
                                        The efforts in the SSI domain is to utilise forms of digital credentials that are certified by authorised issuers which can be in the form of organisations, corporations or government institutions. To store these credentials on the user side, is done through a secure digital mobile wallet application or a desktop application that would be assigned a unique wallet identity number. This number is also stored on the distributed ledger, which will be then be used to assign digital credentials to. Verification of these credentials are done through a mechanism called Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) which relies upon NP-completeness algorithms and attributes derived from credential verification policies to identify only the structure of the credential without compromising user confidentiality through extracting the value behind the attribute.

                                        Identity management on the World Wide Web consists of creating a new username and password for accessing online services or utilising a centralised login through either Google Authentication or Facebook Login both of which share confidential information to third-party companies. To circumnavigate the shortcomings of these technologies SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity) provides a means of authenticating and certifying user requests through ZKP (Zero-Knowledge-Proofs) thus ensuring user privacy is upheld and data shared cannot be compromised by third-party companies.

                          <p>The need for SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity) in the World Wide Web is to introduce forms of identity management that obscure personal data transmitted and housed between online services to reduce the amount of illicit user tracking for profitable gain and mishandling of personal data that would compromise a persons safety in the physical world. The immutability of the distributed ledger provides a layer of authenticity from which one can issue uniquely generated identifiers for credentials and wallets. 
                            The efforts in the SSI domain is to utilise forms of digital credentials that are certified by authorised issuers which can be in the form of organisations, corporations or government institutions. To store these credentials on the user side, is done through a secure digital mobile wallet application or a desktop application that would be assigned a unique wallet identity number. This number is also stored on the distributed ledger, which will be then be used to assign digital credentials to. Verification of these credentials are done through a mechanism called Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) which relies upon NP-completeness algorithms and attributes derived from credential verification policies to identify only the structure of the credential without compromising user confidentiality through extracting the value behind the attribute.
